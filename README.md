# WH-AT Helpdesk (for Windows 10) Build 130.02 Rev 2.0 Installation Files
AppXBundle packages for the Windows 10 C# UWP Helpdesk app that I wrote for my A level computer science project. These files allow you to deploy the Windows 10 app.

# Build information
Target operating system: Windows 10 (Build 10586 and later), x86-64
Compile date: 24/02/2016 10:18am

# For more information about the app please see
Please see the repository 'wh-at-helpdesk' where you can view the C# source code.

# Installation insutrctions
Change BIOS system date to 24/01/2017 (the developer certificate shipped with these files has expired). Download the repository as a zio, extract and right click on Add-AppDevPackage.ps1 and select 'Run with PowerShell'. The app will install. 

Use the following e-mail address to sign in: howarda @ wh-at.net (remove spaces - this email address is no longer active but can still be used to log into the app).

# Known bugs
The build should be stable but please do not attempt to submit tickets from this build - the email address is inactive. The security certificate has expired so it is crucial that the BIOS system date is set to 24/01/2017 in order for the installation to be possible (running this app in a virtualised Windows 10 environment is recommended).
